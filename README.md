P&C Solutions Landing Page
Welcome to the official repository for the P&C Solutions landing page. This is our modern, high-performance digital gateway designed to showcase our expertise as a premier South African business and software engineering firm. We have engineered this site as a single-file solution to ensure maximum speed and effortless deployment.

🚀 Quick Start
Our website utilizes a "standalone" architecture, meaning we do not require Node.js, npm, or any complex installation processes.

Download our index.html file.

Ensure our branding assets (IMG-20251221-WA0013.jpg and IMG-20251221-WA0014.jpg) are located in the same directory as the HTML file.

Launch index.html in any modern web browser to view our site locally.

🛠 Our Features
Zero-Install Architecture: We utilize Tailwind CSS and Lucide Icons via CDN, eliminating the need for node_modules.

Active Contact Form: We have integrated Formspree to deliver our client inquiries directly to our inbox at info@pnct.co.za.

Business-Centric Design: Our layout includes specialized sections highlighting our Software Solutions, Business Solutions, and Website Creations.

Mobile Optimization: Our site is fully responsive and features a floating WhatsApp button for instant local lead generation.

Modern Stack: We built this using HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

📧 How Our Contact Form Works
We have configured our contact form to route all potential lead data directly to our business email.

When a client submits our form, the data is processed through Formspree.

Our Action Required: Upon receiving our very first submission, Formspree will send a verification email to info@pnct.co.za. We must click the "Verify" button in that email to activate the form.

Once we have verified the link, all future client messages will arrive in our inbox automatically.
