P&C Solutions Landing Page
A modern, high-performance landing page for P&C Solutions, a South African business and software engineering firm. This website is built as a single-file solution for maximum speed and ease of deployment.

🚀 Quick Start
Because this website uses a "standalone" architecture, it does not require Node.js, npm, or any installation.

Download the index.html file.

Add your images (IMG-20251221-WA0013.jpg and IMG-20251221-WA0014.jpg) into the same folder.

Open index.html in any web browser to view your site locally.

🛠 Features
Zero-Install Architecture: Uses Tailwind CSS and Lucide Icons via CDN—no node_modules required.

Active Contact Form: Integrated with Formspree to deliver client inquiries directly to info@pnct.co.za.

Business-Centric Design: Includes specific sections for Software Solutions, Business Solutions, and Website Creations.

Mobile Optimized: Fully responsive design with a floating WhatsApp contact button for instant local lead generation.

Modern Stack: Built with HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

📧 How the Contact Form Works
The form is configured to send messages to your business email.

When a user submits the form, the data is sent to Formspree.

Action Required: The very first time you receive a submission, Formspree will send an email to info@pnct.co.za. You must click the "Verify" button in that email to activate the form.

Once verified, all future messages will arrive in your inbox automatically.

🌐 Deployment to GitHub Pages
To put this website online for free:

Create a new repository on GitHub.

Upload index.html and your two .jpg image files.

Go to Settings > Pages.

Under Branch, select main and / (root), then click Save.

Your website will be live at https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/ within minutes.
